## Tools Used:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Project Features:

### Expense and Income Form:

- A form that allows users to enter their expense and income details.
- It includes a dropdown (select) element for choosing between Income and Expense.
- An input field for entering the amount.
- A date picker or input for recording the date of the transaction.
- A submit button to save the expense or income.

### Transaction List:

- Display a list of all recorded expenses and incomes.
- Each transaction entry should show the type (income or expense), amount, and date.

### Expense and Income Total:

- Show the total amount of expenses and income separately.
- Calculate and display the overall budget balance (income minus expenses).

### Data Persistence:

- Utilize localStorage to store and persist user's data input.

### Budget Reset:

- Enable users to reset their budget (i.e., delete all records from the UI and from localStorage).

**Note:** In this project, users are restricted from setting budgets in the future. Therefore, the latest date they can use for a budget entry is the current day. However, they have the flexibility to backdate their transactions.
